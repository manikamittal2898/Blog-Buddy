<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
I aim to make an application called ‘Blog-Buddy’ that assists budding bloggers by automatically generating tags for their articles. It will also generate an insightful word cloud for the articles to give the bloggers an idea about the word distribution in their article. This visual representation of keyword metadata can help the writers to get some insights which could help them to improve their word choice.
<h1>Motivation</h1>
Having recently started with blogging on Medium, I was facing a problem in coming up with appropriate tags for my article. Moreover, I found myself using some words too frequently unintentionally. And so I thought if I could automate the process of tagging, it could make the lives of bloggers way more convenient. Plus, generating a word cloud could help to minimize unnecessarily high usage of some words,
<h1>Goals</h1>
Generate a word cloud of the most prominent words in the blog draft.
Suggests list of suitable tags for the blog article.
<h1>Details</h1>
<h2>Frontend</h2>
The frontend will be a webpage that supports upload and copy-paste of the text to be analyzed. It will present results to the users in the form of - word cloud and suggested tags.
<h2>Backend</h2>
Using an algorithm based on n-gram analysis, topic analysis and some other heuristics, it generates word cloud and a list of suitable tags for the text submitted for analysis.
